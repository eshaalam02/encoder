Encoder

An encoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts an active input signal into a binary code. It is a critical component in digital systems where multiple inputs need to be uniquely represented using a smaller set of output lines. Encoders are widely used in applications like digital communication systems, memory address decoding, and data compression.


Working Principle

Encoders operate under the assumption that only one input is active (logic high, 1) at any given time. Based on the position of the active input, the encoder generates a binary code as output.
